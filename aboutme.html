                            <p>I'm amateur photography, with a deep passion for capturing the beaty in everyday moments.
                            For me, photography is more than just a hobby, it's a way to tell stories and connect with people.
                            My approach is centered around finding authentecity in each shot, wheather it's a family gathering, a quit landscape, or a spontaneous candid moment.I believe that every image should capture a feeling, something that resonates with viewers long after the moment has passed.
                            When I'm not behind the lens, I love to explore creative side through cooking and art, which I also share by teaching fun, interactive classes to preschoolers.
                            If you are looking for a photographer  who values connection, creativity,and authenticity, I'd be thrilled to work with you and bring your vision to life.
